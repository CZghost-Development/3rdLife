# 3rdLife
Grian's semi-hardcore SMP turned into a plugin: Add it to your Spigot/Paper server and play!

## Coming soon!
This plugin is in early active development. Please be patient, a working alpha version will
be out soon for testing!

## What is it all about?
CZghost speaking here. I've been watching an SMP mini-series Grian made, with the name 3rd Life.  
![3rd Life Logo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/3rd-life-smp/images/3/3b/3rdlifelogo.webp/revision/latest?cb=20210423062445)

The series is a semi-hardcore PVP Survival full of cooperation, with a twist. Each player has
3 lives assigned to them. These lives are displayed via nametag colour that changes according
to their current lives status. On their 1st life, their name is green, and everything is fine.
If they die, they'll get in their 2nd life and their nametag turns yellow. They'll still peaceful
and cooperative like nothing happened, but they're in the danger zone, because when they die again,
on their 3rd life, their nametag turns red and their goal changes. They now are off to hunt other
players down and kill everyone else. Players of course can defend themselves, but green and yellow
nametags shouldn't initiate PVP against other players, not even red ones. Only when red stikes
first, green or yellow player shall defend themselves. If the red nametag dies again, they enter
the spectator mode and basically lost. The series end for themselves.

## Plugin?
Of course. I guess that Grian made a datapack actually that has the function. I don't know
whether the datapack gets released after the series end or not, but eighter way, I think that
having a plugin is better in my opinion. It depends on if you prefer to use Realms or optimized
Spigot or Paper server. Realms server doesn't support any kind of Bukkit plugin, it is essentially
a pure vanilla server, so for you guys, a datapack is the only viable option. For modded servers
(including those that use Proximity Chat Mod), it depends on whether your modded server engine
supports also standard Bukkit/Spigot plugins. It may even be possible to install a mod that allows
you to include support for Bukkit/Spigot plugins for your server. If you are hosting a Spigot
or Paper server and you are thinking of adding a seasoned SMP action to your server, 3rd Life plugin
may be a good choice for you. The plugin is rather compatible with other plugins that extend
the function of your server (warps, teleporting, chat plugins, etc.), however I would suggest you
to keep various plugins at minimum as some plugins may interfere with the 3rd Life plugin's core
functionality. I'd suggest you to only keep essential plugins (permissions, security, etc.)
and keep the server as much vanilla as possible. Honestly, that's up to you, actually. I'll try to
make a datapack as well, and that should have pretty much the same function as the plugin. It is
only a option for you guys who cannot use the glory of plugin for whatever reason. Plugin is however
smoother and essentially works better than datapack. The only mandatory condition is a compatible
server engine.
